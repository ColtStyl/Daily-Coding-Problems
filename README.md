# Daily-Coding-Problems
This is a repository I use to store my Daily Coding Problems solutions/ideas. 

Daily Coding Problems is a mailing list that sends a daily coding problem to your mailbox. The problems vary in difficulties and come from coding interviews done by different companies like Amazon, Google, Uber, etc...

I will publish my solutions to those problems, or at the very least my attempts since some of these problems are very complex to solve without the help of the internet.
This is my way of using multiples programming languages and learning some mathematical/algorithmic principles.
